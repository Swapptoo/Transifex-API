## Languages

The `Languages` class is the interface to Transifex' [languages API](http://docs.transifex.com/api/languages/) endpoints.

### Getting a Languages object

An instance of the `Languages` class should be retrieved through the `Transifex` class' `get()` factory.

```php
/** @var \Mautic\Transifex\Connector\Languages $languages */
$languages = $transifex->get('languages');
```

This method also has two optional parameters to pass additional information:

* An array containing optional additional params to send with the request, this array should contain the 'translators', 'reviewers', and 'list' options with the option's name as a key in the array (associative array, defaults to an empty array)

## Resources

The `Resources` class is the interface to Transifex' [resources API](http://docs.transifex.com/api/resources/) endpoints.

### Getting a Resources object

An instance of the `Resources` class should be retrieved through the `Transifex` class' `get()` factory.

```php
/** @var \Mautic\Transifex\Connector\Resources $resources */
$resources = $transifex->get('resources');
```

### Create a resource

To create a new resource in a project, call the `Resources::createResource()` method.

This method has three required parameters:

* The slug for the project (string)
* The name of the resource (string)
* The slug for the resource (string)
* The resource's file type (string)

This method also has one optional parameter to pass additional information:

* An array containing optional additional params to send with the request, this array should contain all additional options not specified in the method's other parameters (associative array, defaults to an empty array)

NOTE: To upload contents for this resource, this method allows either a filename or a string containing the contents. The filename should be passed in the 'file' key of the options array and the string contents passed in the 'content' key.

```php
$apiResponse = $transifex->get('resources')->createResource('my-project', 'Resource 1', 'resource-1', 'INI');
```

If a filename has been provided and the file does not exist, an `\InvalidArgumentException` is thrown.
